# 💕 Will You Be My Valentine, Sarah? 💕

A cute and interactive Valentine's Day website to ask that special someone to be your Valentine! Built with love (and a little bit of JavaScript trickery 😏).

## ✨ Features

- 🐻 Personalized Valentine's ask-out page
- 🏃 **The "No" button runs away** — good luck trying to click it!
- 📈 The "Yes" button **grows bigger** with every failed "No" attempt
- 💖 Floating hearts background animation
- 🎉 Heart burst celebration when she says **YES!**
- ✨ Sparkle trail cursor effect
- 📱 Mobile-friendly design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS (with animations & gradients)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedhasin/Valentines-Sarah.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Send the link to your special someone 💌
4. Wait for the inevitable **YES!** 🎉

## 📸 Preview

The page features a personal photo, a heartfelt question, and two buttons — but only one of them actually works 😉

## 💡 How It Works

- Hovering over the **"No"** button causes it to fly to a random spot on the screen
- Each attempt makes the **"Yes"** button grow larger and more persuasive
- The **"No"** button shrinks and gets increasingly desperate
- Clicking **"Yes"** triggers a celebration with heart bursts and a sweet message

## 🫶 Made With Love
