# Will You Be My Valentine, Sarah? 

A cute and interactive Valentine's Day website to ask that special someone to be your Valentine! Built with love (and a little bit of JavaScript trickery 😏).

## ✨ Features

- Squirrel Personalized Valentine's ask-out page
-  **The "No" button runs away** — good luck trying to click it!
-  The "Yes" button **grows bigger** with every failed "No" attempt
-  Floating hearts background animation
-  Heart burst celebration when she says **YES!**
-  Sparkle trail cursor effect
-  Mobile-friendly design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS (with animations & gradients)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedhasin/Valentines-Sarah.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Send the link to your special someone 💌
4. Wait for the inevitable **YES!** 🎉

## 📸 Preview

The page features a personal photo, a heartfelt question, and two buttons — but only one of them actually works 😉

## 💡 How It Works

- Hovering over the **"No"** button causes it to fly to a random spot on the screen
- Each attempt makes the **"Yes"** button grow larger and more persuasive
- The **"No"** button shrinks and gets increasingly desperate
- Clicking **"Yes"** triggers a celebration with heart bursts and a sweet message
